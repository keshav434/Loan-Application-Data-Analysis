Project Info:
Rahuri Finance requires building an AI model to predict the "Loan Payment Failure" tendency (a binary classification problem) for a given loan application. Additionally, we need to identify any bias towards specific attributes.

Project Steps:

(a) Preprocessing:

Detail the preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, plotting graphs, data discretization, normalization, and data encoding.

(b) Initial Data Exploration:

Utilize techniques like association rule mining and clustering for initial data exploration to identify potential biases. Report any findings.

(c) Building the Classification Model:

Explore various classification techniques (e.g., Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and Ensemble methods).
Evaluate training and validation errors to determine model suitability.
Use cross-validation for model assessment and perform hyperparameter tuning with tools like GridSearchCV.
Report the final cross-validated accuracies and optimal hyperparameters for each classification model.
Tools and Libraries:

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
